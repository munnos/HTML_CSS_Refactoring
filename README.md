# HTML_CSS_Refactoring

In this project, I have addressed previous accesibility and semantic issues within the HTML file.

# Semantic refactoring
To address the semantic issues, I have added a navigation bar and a footer to make the html more readable for other developers and to help with search engine optimization. Furthermore, previously the footer element had h2 tags within it when they were h3 tags within the code above it so this has been changed to h4 to enhance the webpage's readibility, and more importantly give the webpage a logical structure.
To further enhance search engine optimization, I have also added a concise title "Horiseon - A Marketing Agency" to improve the ranking the website will appear in a Google search, for example.

# Accessibility refactoring
To address the accessibility issues, I have added alt attributes for all images in the HTML to assist disabled users in understanding the content of the images. As the background image was within the CSS file, I have instead used a title tag in the html which fulfils the same purpose in giving an explanation of the image.

# Other refactoring
I added an id tag for "search-engine-optimization" as previously the button in the navigation bar was not re-directing the user to the relevant section as intended.
